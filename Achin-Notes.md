Effective random testing of concurrent programs
-- They talk about model checking which is systematic search of the state space. Howeer, the number ofinterlavings in a concurren
 program goes exponentially with the ength of the execution. This is a state-explosion problems.

 SOoooooo, do random. Pick a thread
 
 The question is how to sample partial orders...one linearization of a partial order exhibits an errors, then all linearizations will. A endom approach should not just waste time on a single partial order.
 
 This paper is a novel algorithm to sample partial order.
